# Angry Reviewer Obsidian Plugin

Plugin provides style suggestions for academic and scientific text in a new window in Obsidian.
It works with any text, but suggestions are even better with Latex files of scientific papers.
This plugin is the offline version of the free web-service AngryReviewer.com developed by anufrievroman.
You can read about the rules used in the suggestion algorithm [here](https://www.angryreviewer.com/rules).
